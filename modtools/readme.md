## set-need
Allows for modifying the focus levels for needs on units via DFhack scripts. Was made a while ago and may now be outdated. I believe I originally made this as part of a trial "Sims Fortress" mod, inspired by the toy-usage to give good thoughts from Masterwork. The idea was to add in special workshops that have reactions that fulfill certain hard to satisfy needs for the units performing them e.g. "Pen a letter to family" for fulfilling the need to be with family, "Have a personal feast" for fulling the need to have a decent meal.
## set-personality
Allows for modifying of a unit's personality facets via DFhack scripts. Was made a while ago and may now be outdated.
## set-belief
Allows for the modifying of a unit's beliefs via DFhack scripts. Was made a while ago and may now be outdated.
