# Dwarf-Fortress-Mods
An assortment of my DF mods and DFhack scripts, ranging from complete, to random scraps.

## gm-newnit
A version of gui/gm-unit from the base DFhack scripts that adds the ability to change the unit's personality, beliefs, and physical appearance. This was made a while ago, and may no longer work properly. It was also my first and only attempt at GUI-related DFhackery, and so may be janky (though it works). *Requires modtools/set-personality and modtools/set-belief. Find them in the modtools section of this repo.*
